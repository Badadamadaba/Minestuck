Minestuck
=========

Minestuck is a mod for Minecraft that adds game elements from the webcomic Homestuck into Minecraft.

We hope to implement:
* Punchcard alchemy
* Places like Skaia, Prospit and Derse
* Custom and unique lands for each player
* SBURB client/server chains
* Tons of Homestuck themed items
